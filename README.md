# GUI-Calculator
My first simple calculator made in my software development and design concepts class.
I created my first GUI calculator and learned a bit of new coding with C#. I'm excited where this will lead me as I want to learn more code in C# especially when it comes to my desire to learn to create games on Unity which also uses C# code.
